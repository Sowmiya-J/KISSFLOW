**Automatic room light using arduino and PIRÂ sensor** : The goal of an automatic room light system using Arduino and a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor is to enhance energy efficiency and convenience by automating lighting control. The PIR sensor detects motion within its range, signaling the Arduino to switch the room light on when someone enters and off when the room is vacant. This system minimizes unnecessary electricity usage by ensuring lights are only on when needed, reducing energy consumption and costs. It also provides hands-free operation, making it particularly useful in homes, offices, and public spaces where frequent manual switching is impractical.


**RFID BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM**  : The goal of an RFID-based attendance system combined with a PIR sensor is to streamline and automate the process of tracking attendance, enhancing accuracy and security. RFID tags assigned to individuals are scanned by the RFID reader, recording their presence when they enter a designated area. The PIR sensor detects motion to activate the system, ensuring it operates only when someone is present, conserving energy. This integration minimizes manual entry errors, prevents proxy attendance, and provides real-time data for efficient monitoring in educational institutions, workplaces, and events, ultimately fostering accountability and ease of attendance management.
